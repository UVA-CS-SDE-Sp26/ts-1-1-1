Overview:
- The Cipher class creates objects that take in the name of a file
- This file holds a key (two lines) that are used to decipher a ciphered string
- My implementation:
    - First I access the key file using the getCipherLines() method
    - This method accesses the file and puts each line into an ArrayList
    - After some validation, the lines from the ArrayList are taken out and put into separate strings
    - Then, they are validated further
    - Then, the createHashMap() method uses both of these strings as the key and value for a HashMap
    - Then, the HashMap we have now created is used to decode a string inputted into the method
        arguments of the decipherStringInput() method
    - Finally, this method will output the deciphered version of the inputted string and now we have
        accomplished the goal of his part of the homework

Validation of Cipher Explanation:
- When a cipher/key file is accessed, it is checked for:
    - Having two lines
    - Both lines having the same number of characters
    - The Ciphered line having distinct characters so that one character does not map to two different values
